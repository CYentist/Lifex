I decided to invest my energy on the Gapminder data mostly because I was very inspired by the website Gapminder.com and it's founder - . My research question will be **how the urbanization influence economy**. So I will see whether GDP growth is associated with urabnization rate. 

[Giorgio Fagiolo][1], [Rrichard Florida][2] and other researcher found that "urbanization to be associated with economic growth over the past five centuries", [Tripathi][3] and [Vernon][4] also encourage government in developing country should invest in urbanization. However, "The idea of large cities and high urbanization rates has, like many other innovations, diffused slowly across countries and time."and **there is a best degree of urban concentration, in terms of maximizing productivity growth, that best degree varies with the level of development and country size.**

They may be related under some certain conditions, but **when would the two factor go together**. And should govermant invest resources in urbanization to boost economy, that's another question need to be answered.

My hypothesis is, **as economic growth, urbanization rate will increase.** But this corelation might become weak as the country developing.

My second question is will urbanization rate associated with employment rate?

Since the gapminder code book is not very big, it's OK to be used directly.
