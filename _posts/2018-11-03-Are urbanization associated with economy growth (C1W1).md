I decided to invest my energy on the Gapminder data mostly because I was very inspired by the website Gapminder.com and it's founder - . My research question will be **how the urbanization influence economy**. So I will see whether GDP growth is associated with urabnization rate. 

[Giorgio Fagiolo][1], [RICHARD FLORIDA][2] and other researcher found that "urbanization to be associated with economic growth over the past five centuries", however, "The idea of large cities and high urbanization rates has, like many other innovations, diffused slowly across countries and time."

They may be related under some certain conditions, but **when would the two factor go together**. And should govermant invest resources in urbanization to boost economy, that's another question need to be answered.

Since the gapminder code book is not very big, it's OK to be used directly.
