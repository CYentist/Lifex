1. The sample I gonna use is the Gapminder data. It collected some country level statistical data like urban rate, income per person and employ rate. In total, it has 213 observations. Since th.e data set is very small one, I will use the whole data set for analysis.
2. The gapminder data set is observational data set came from data reporting. The website founder collocted all the data to demonstrate the trend of human development to public. Data may came from the offcial report of each county or other related world wide orgnizations. The gapminder is updating their data on daily basis. The data I will use is came form the Coursera course, which is the year of 2009.
3.  The topic I interested in how the urban rate effect people's living standard. I choose income per person to simply repersent the living of people, which is my response variable. However, urban rate itself may not cause higher income. I will take employ rate, internet use rate, and life expectancy into consideration as explanatory variables. These variables may have correlation with one another, even causation. So I need to find out which is the confounder or mediator in my model. I will use most of the data as numeric variables. But some time they need to be converted to categorical variables to be able to be oberseved in different levels.
