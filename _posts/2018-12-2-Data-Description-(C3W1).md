1. The sample I gonna use is the Gapminder data. It's observational data set came from data reporting.
2. The topic I interested in how the urban rate effect people's living standard. I choose income per person to simply repersent the living of people. However, urban rate itself may not cause higher income. I will take employ rate, internet use rate, and life expectancy into consideration. These variables may have correlation with one another, even causation. So I need to find out which is the confounder or mediator in my model. 
3. I will use most of the data as numeric variables. But some time they need to be converted to categorical variables to be able to be oberseved in different levels.
